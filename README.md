# Hi, I'm Pablo Bedolla
I'm second-year student at Dominican University. I have found a passion in the field of Mathematics and Computer Science. Iam currently focused building a machine learning model that uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and image processing to create visual representations of the timeline of what people with dementia see.
