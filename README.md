# Hi, I'm Pablo Bedolla
I'm second-year student at Dominican University. I have found a passion in the field of Mathematics and Computer Science. I have a strong interest in both fields, thus I have chosen to study in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, where I am able to combine my love for math and logic with my interest in technology and its applications. I am looking forward to continuing my education in these fields and seeing where it takes me in my future career. I'm currently focused on studying Network Analysis and Graph Theory applications in Computer Science.
