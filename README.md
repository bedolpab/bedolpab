## Pablo C. Bedolla Ortiz.
I am primarily interested in cryptography and quantum algorithms/computing applications (pqc) to cryptography. My recent work spans optimized data wrangling and data algorithms at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Currently conducting research on ML/AI/NLP-driven solutions for test engineering at JPL.
