# Hi, I'm Pablo Bedolla
As a second-year student at Dominican University, I have found a passion in the intersection of Mathematics and Computer Science. With a strong interest in both fields, I have chosen to study in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, where I am able to combine my love for math and logic with my interest in technology and its applications. I am especially excited about the potential of Machine Learning and its ability to improve decision-making and automate processes. I see the combination of my interests in computer science and mathematics as a powerful tool for solving real-world problems. I am looking forward to continuing my education in these fields and seeing where it takes me in my future career.
